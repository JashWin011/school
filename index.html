<p> ST. JOSEPH'S EDUCATION SOCIETY:

    St. Joseph's Education Society started the Society's first institution namely, St Anthony's High School in the Himayathnagar area, in the year 1971 with classes I to V with English as the medium of instruction. It is said that like spring the beginnings of all great things are small. The school which started on a modest scale quickly attained name and fame in the twin cities and by the year 1976-77 it became a full fledged high school and the first batch of 10th class students appeared for the SSC public examination in March, 1977. The result in the public exam was near cent percent. The school now has a strength of nearly 3000 students. St. Joseph's Public School, A. G. Palace is another institution under the same management. It was started in the year 2000 and is affiliated to ICSE, New Delhi.
    
    Though academic excellence is the main aim of our institutions, it is necessary to expose the students to outside world to relax and think. To this end, the activities of various clubs like Science Club, Literary Club in our institutions helped to draw out and develop the talents and skills in the students. Our institutions have encouraged the students to participate in various activities conducted by organizations like NTSE, Maths Olympiad, and also involve in UN Day Celebrations every year. Our students are encouraged to participate in physical education activities. They excelled in BasketBall, Cricket, Tennis, Swimming, and Roller skating events held at National and State level. It is a regular annual feature with all our institutions to take the students on educational tours to various places of historical and cultural interest in the country.
    
    Leadership is a potent combination of character and strategy. Leadership qualities have to be nurtured at school to train future citizens. School Cabinet and Parliament plays a vital role in inculcating democratic principles and practices in the students. The functioning of School Cabinets and School Parliaments in our institutions has been very successful in that a strong foundation is laid for the future parliamentarians and legislators.
